filter: This method is used to create a new array with all elements that pass a certain test implemented by a provided function. In the context of this example, it's used to keep only the snacks with the type "sweet."

map: This method is used to create a new array populated with the results of calling a provided function on every element in the calling array. In this example, it's used to transform each "sweet" snack into a new object with only the item and price properties.

The combined use of filter and map in this example allows for a concise way to first select a subset of the data (filter) and then transform it into a desired format (map).
